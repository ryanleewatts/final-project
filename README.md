# What does Brexit mean for flight delay compensation?
You can view the 'final project' from my MA at: <a href="final-project.ryanleewatts.com">final-project.ryanleewatts.com</a>

It's really, really wrong - I made (quite) a few statistical mistakes and it's certainly not the fairest piece in the world. I'm keeping it up though because it was the basis of my pitch to the BBC, where I interned in the summer of 2017.

During that time, we made a <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-40831970">calculator which told you the average flight delays between airports.</a>

I'm very proud of this one, and extremely grateful to the Visual Journalism team for turning a very average final project into something cool.
