        <p>
          The EU has offered peace of mind to Brits taking to the skies for 13 years, having introduced flight delay compensation regulations in 2004.
        </p>
        <p>
          In that time, 145k flights have been delayed by more than three hours, according to data from the <a href="https://www.caa.co.uk/home/">Civil Aviation Authority.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          24% of flights between the UK and European nations fall into the EU’s definition of a delayed flight, arriving at their destination 15 minutes later than expected. 0.7% of flights qualify for the maximum compensation, having been delayed by over three hours.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the impending British exit from the European Union, <a href="http://www.which.co.uk/">consumer groups</a> are debating what the next steps are for the UK to ensure consumer rights are entrenched.
        </p>

        <p>
          Independent from complications that arise as a consequence to Brexit, <a href="http://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/travel/passenger-rights/air/index_en.htm">the EU is currently negotiating some of the terms of the legislation</a> which ensures air passengers are appropriately compensated if a flight is unfairly delayed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jacqueline Foster, Deputy leader of the Conservative MEPs, said: “The EU is currently in some debate over flight compensation. For the last two to three years, there have been problems with some of the court rulings determining the details of the law. The regulation is stuck in limbo in the European Parliament.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The Conservative’s European spokesperson for Transport reports that there are numerous hang-ups with regards to how much power airlines should have in determining the conditions of compensating people who suffer delays.
        </p>
        <p>
          She continued: “There have been complications in deciding who decides what conditions qualify for compensation and whether instances of technical faults, for example, should be included."
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently, <a href="http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/holidays/article-2271213/How-claim-EU-flight-delay-compensation-EC-261-2004.html">EU regulation 261/2004</a> known colloquially as ‘261’ codifies the rights of all EU citizens to fair compensation in the face of significant delays. Depending on distance, airlines are required to hand over €250 to €600 for flights between EU countries.
        </p>
        <p>
          The delay must be the fault of the airline, and compensation can be withheld in cases of ‘extraordinary circumstance’ that are noted to be out of the airlines control. The EU provides consumer confidence through statute law and airlines have always accepted the regulations.
        </p>

        <p>
          Foster does not expect the UK leaving the EU to have much of an effect on how consumers are protected. She said: “<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-great-repeal-bill-white-paper">In terms of Brexit,</a> I don't think there will be any change at all in terms of Britain being compliant with existing regulations. It's written into our statues and when we leave the EU all of this legislation will stay in place. I wouldn't expect the government to pull out in this area.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The UK’s hand in crafting the legislation, Foster believes, is enough to ensure the ‘261’ will stay in some form. She continues: "There will be a number of areas where we have been part and parcel of framing this legislation; the UK is a world leader when it comes to consumer rights. I don't think the consumer will lose out here and it would be far too complicated to change the law depending on where a flight takes off and lands"
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/news/flight-delay-compensation-eu261-brexit/">Data shows that the airlines have decreased delays</a> in the last year, with 2016 proving the most punctual since the regulation was bought in. Yearly figures have fluctuating, however, and there was a difference of 200k in the total number of flight delays between 2009 and 2010.
        </p>
        <p>
          2010 was also the worst year on record for flight delays over one hour, with 117k flights absent from the tarmac for at least 60 minutes. In comparison, less than 30k flights were delayed for this long last year.

          It is too early to tell what impact system’s failures for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jun/13/ba-capita-call-centres-it-meltdown-airline-outsourcing-flight-cancellations">British Airways</a> and Thomas Cook will have on figures for 2017. On May 27, a technical glitch caused delays as long as 14 hours for thousands of passengers flying from UK airports.
        </p>
        <p>
          Technical difficulties also plagued check-in desks for Thomas Cook flights from Manchester airport, causing further delays on June 14. There is no consistent process for seeking compensation and most airlines require differing levels of proof of delay.
        </p>
        <p>
          Joe Patten, a spokesperson for <a href="http://www.which.co.uk/">Which?,</a> said: "There's quite a confusing system domestically for when people have complaints about airlines: different airlines are signed up for different arbitration schemes and it's not always clear to whom a passenger should go."
        </p>
        <p>
          Which? reported a 230% increase in visitors to their <a href="http://www.which.co.uk/consumer-rights/l/flights">pages related to flight compensation.</a> Whilst this is expected as consumers look forward to their summer plans, such an increase, according to Which?, correlates to recent systems issues for airlines such as British Airways.
        </p>
        <p>
          "In the instance of BA we don't think they are actively doing enough to inform passengers of their rights. Everything is a bit unclear at the moment. Everything is up in the air because it's all EU regulations, but compensation when your flight is delayed is something we want to see maintained for consumers.        </p>
        <p>
          In responding to the uncertainty of the role of European law following Brexit, Which? Have endorsed the idea of creating a ‘travel ombudsman’ responsible for consumer protection at a national level. An ombudsman is seen as something, “that would fall nicely into that post-brexit landscape."
        </p>

        <img src="gatwick.jpg" width="650px"></img>
        <div class="caption"><p>The average delay at Gatwick airport in 2016 was 18 and a half minutes</p></div>

        <p>
          Calls for a travel ombudsman have been reinforced by <a href="http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/">Money Saving Expert,</a> a website offering travel advice to consumers in the UK.
        </p>
        <p>
          Site founder Martin Lewis expressed his concerns whenever compensation law is liable to change. He said: “We much prefer when the rights of the consumer are extended and situations where these rights are called into debate or subject to interference does cause concern.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Lewis understands Brexit to be an opportunity to reaffirm the rights of consumers and, dependent on how it would be organised, is supportive of an ombudsman for travel. “I think it’s a sensible idea, and would certainly keep consumer protection independent from those with an interest in reining things in.”
        </p>
        <p>
          CAA data has also shown large differences in the average flight delay for competing airports. Only 50 miles separate Gatwick airport from the City of London airport, yet the average delay at Gatwick is 18 and a half minutes compared to just over 9 in the city.
        </p>
        <p>
          Manchester and Heathrow have also consistently featured lengthy delays, with the average delay at each airport being 17.7 and 16.3 minutes respectively. Over a quarter of flights leaving Heathrow airport in 2016 were officially delayed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Heathrow and Gatwick airports were unavailable for comment when asked to respond to the data.

        <p>
          When a flight is delayed, a chain reaction will begin. Annoyance begets anger begets logistical problems surrounding food, drink and general customer welfare - all at significant cost to passenger and airline alike.
        </p>
        <p>
          Flights delayed by more than 5 hours are rare. CAA data provides a figure for flights delayed by over 5 hours and, even then, this only represents 0.007% of flights. When it does happen, however, airlines are expected to compensate those affected justly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alexandra Ma flew from London Heathrow to Hong Kong International Airport in December, and was delayed for a total of 5 hours and 40 minutes. First whilst waiting for the plane to arrive and then, again, waiting for takeoff.
        </p>
        <p>
          She said: “I have never seen such an uproar. I was naturally upset because it was the holidays and I was looking forward to seeing my family. To suffer through a delay for two separate incidents was awful luck.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Alexandra was told, whilst she could claim for the first delay as it had been caused by air traffic control, the second delay was caused by ‘exceptional circumstances’ and British Airways were under no obligation to cough up. “Like the 300 other people on that flight, I was very disappointed.”

              ‘261’ is a comprehensive ruling and covers downgrades, cancellations and instances where boarding is denied despite a passenger arriving on time - in addition to delays. Discrepancies between airlines, however, limit its scope.
            </p>
            <p>
              In some instances claiming compensation couldn’t be simpler. When Danielle O’Sullivan, a student at Warwick University, and her touring party of 40 university dodgeball players found themselves delayed for three and a half hours, the process of claiming couldn’t have been simpler.
            </p>
            <p>
              She explained: “The tour organisers handled everything. They emailed EasyJet when we landed, almost immediately. We returned to England on a flight that was on time and had our compensation confirmed that day.”
            </p>
            <p>
              The budget airline awarded the EU mandated €340 per person within one week of the incident.

          “If you’re prepared to do your time and end up with your money back, I think it’s more than tolerable” Danielle continued, “There’s a big difference, however, between university students on holiday than, say, a young family or someone desperate to get home.”

          When compensation is refused, however, airlines can be known to offer little to no compromise when passengers are persistent. Youth worker Matthew Miller emailed Spanish budget airline Vueling 11 times when his flight from Luton to Amsterdam was delayed.

        <p>
          “We boarded the plane at 20:45 to take off just after 21:00. The queue at check-in, waiting to board at the gate and getting seated had all individually take longer than the flight would take. We were on the Tarmac for over two hours because of the weather.”
        </p>
        <p>
          “I explained this to Vueling and complained about how we were treated onboard, not even being offered water. The weather was like a get out of jail free card and they treated it like it just absolved them of basic sympathy.”

          Weather conditions are out of the hands of the airlines, and under EU legislation they invoke claims of ‘force majeure’: exceptional and unforeseeable circumstances pertaining to weather, industrial action and even political instability.
        </p>
        <p>
          Advice offered to travellers on the flyertalk forum, a community for frequent and active air passengers, covers what counts as ‘exceptional circumstances’ and is often corroborated by moderators from airlines themselves. BA is well represented, with members of the community referring to ‘Naomi’, a user affiliated with the BA’s customer service team, with fondness and appreciation.

          ‘Flyertalk’ users maintain this attitude in spite of BA’s recent systems outage; an IT fault caused by human error which sparked delays of up to 14 hours for passengers travelling on the weekend of May 27 and 28. All baggage in transit during the delays is yet to be fully accounted for, and the compensation bill is estimated to run into the millions.

              Simon Cornish was one of the lucky ones. He counts his near miss as otherworldly intervention: “It was destiny, I feel incredibly lucky. We landed and I switched my phone on; I saw the news of the systems failure. We were reading about the 12 hour waits the next day and counting our blessings.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Simon’s flight landed on the morning of May 27 and was held up “for only a little bit” when passengers departed the plane. Had he flown a day later, he could have faced a 12 hour wait.
            </p>
            <p>
              Matt Givens, a British national working in Germany, was less fortunate and suffered the full brunt of an 11 hour delay in Heathrow’s ‘Terminal 5.’ His frequent flyer status, regularly travelling between London and Berlin for work, means the novelty of boarding a plane has worn off completely. “I just want to get it over with, I fly so much so I’m very sensitive to flights which go wrong. The 11 hours I spent in limbo were horrific and I wouldn’t wish it on anyone.”
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
          For Matt, the compensation process has been far from straightforward. “I’ve been promised the money so many times, had the amount confirmed by multiple people and I’ve still not received anything. It costs 50p a minute to contact BA, it feels like you can’t win.”
